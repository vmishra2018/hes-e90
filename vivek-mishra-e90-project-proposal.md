#### Project statement 

With this project my main goal is to get familiar with few of unexplored terrorities of AWS. and with this project I am targetting alexa and aws rekognition.

1. Build an alexa skill to turn on lights using rapberry pi.
2. Build an alexa skill to take a photo and use aws rekognition api to recognize the person.



#### Techstack
I am planning to use rapberry pi3 with common led lights, I will also use a 5 mp camera to take the picture for the second use case.

For the custom programs I am planning to use Python and Json. Json is primarily for building the alexa skill.




#### AWS Resources

I will be using the following aws resources for this project
1.  IAM
2.  Alexa
3.  AWS IOT(depends on how far I get.)
4.  AWS REKOGNITION



#### Project Benefits

I have always wanted to do build a magic mirror and integrate it with alexa . This project will give the enough background for aws world and raspberry pi to get started for that.
